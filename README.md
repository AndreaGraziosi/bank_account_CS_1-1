# bank_account_CS_1-1
Welcome to My Bank account Assignment!

This is a simple assignment using class and objects.

I created a class named BankAccount and instantiated 3 different versions of the BankAccount() object. Just like opening 3 unique bank accounts using the blue print of the class created.

The class contains one attribute 'routing number' that is common to all new accounts, and so was not included inside the __init__ method. Instance variables within the __init__ method are unique to the created instance, those attributes and variables are customer's names bank balances and account numbers.
Methods or behaviors created for this class are: deposit, withdraw, get balance, add interest and print receipt.
